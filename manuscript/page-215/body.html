He appeared at Ned’s room wearing his old brown sweater and a pair of heavy shoes, one toe of which showed the effects of many collisions with the football. Ned looked him over and shook his head.</p><p>“You can’t do anything with that sweater, Curt,” he said. “It binds your arms too much. It isn’t cold to-day.
