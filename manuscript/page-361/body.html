Wave on high your banners blue,<br>Cheer for comrades staunch and true;<br>We are here to die or do,<br>Fighting for Old Yardley!</p><p>“All together! Cheer on cheer!  
Victory is ours to-day!  
Raise your voices loud and clear!  
Yardley pluck has won the fray!

Flaunt the Blue that never pales,<br>Fighting for Old Yardley!”</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">In front of the gymnasium the crowd gathered and began the cheers for the players. “Rah, rah, rah! Rah,</p></div> </div>
