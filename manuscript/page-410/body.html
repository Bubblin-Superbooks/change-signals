Here’s something,” announced  Dan. “‘Wissining, Conn., November 16. Yardley Hall School and Broadwood Academy will meet to-morrow on the Yardley gridiron for their annual championship battle. Yardley is expected to repeat her victories of the last two years, although a piece of eleventh-hour ill-luck may spoil her chances. Yardley’s captain and left end, Dan Vinton, may not be able to enter the game. Captain Vinton has been ill for about a week and on Thursday, obeying doctor’s orders, left school and has not been heard of since. Whether he will return in time for the game to-morrow, or whether, if he does return, he will be able to take part in it, is not known. Vinton’s leadership and his work at the left end of the Yardley line will be greatly missed.’”</p></div> </div>
