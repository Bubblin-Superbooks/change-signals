I thought we might as well fill the car while we were about it.”</p><p>Dan did mind, but didn’t say so. In front of Clarke stood a big black touring car, its searchlights already casting white floods of light along the gravel drive. The chauffeur left the seat as  the boys came down the steps and stood at attention, touching his cap to them.</p><p>“Hello, Higgins!” said Dan. “How are you?”</p><p>“Nicely, Mr. Dan. You’re well, sir, I hope?”</p><p>“Fine and dandy, Higgins,” replied Dan, feeling at the moment that this was really so. Gerald spoke for a moment in low tones with Higgins and then took the driver’s seat, remarking in what seemed an unnecessarily loud tone: “We’re going to take a ride first, Higgins. Get on the running board and I’ll take you as far as the station.”</p><p>“Very well, sir.”</p></div> </div>
