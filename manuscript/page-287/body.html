I don’t know him very well. I used to think he was a bit stuck-up, but several fellows have told me I was wrong.”</p><p>“You were,” replied Dan earnestly. “Gerald’s just as decent a chap as there is in school, and I’m not saying that because he’s my roommate or because I sort of brought him up. But I will acknowledge that he wasn’t very promising when he first came. His father had pretty nearly spoiled him without realizing it a bit. But Yardley is a great place to take the nonsense out of a fellow. Gerald had his troubles for a while and then, having plenty of common sense, he took a tumble and knuckled down.”</p><p>“I ran across quite a character the other day,” said Ned. “I guess it was two or three weeks ago now. A fellow named Burtis.”</p></div> </div>
