Was it Benson?”</p><p>“Burtis, sir.”</p><p>“Burtis, of course!” Mr. Dana slapped his knee. “And how are your folks, Burtis? Father and mother well, I hope? They’re nice people. We had a bully summer up there that time.”</p><p>“Yes, sir, thank you, they’re all well.”</p><p>“And the old spotted cow that chased me out  of the barnyard one morning?

What noble deed have you performed to be allowed to wear that proud insignia?”</p></div> </div>
