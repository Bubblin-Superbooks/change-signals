Well, I’ll speak to Staniford to-morrow; he’s captain of the Second, you know; perhaps he will find something for you, although, as you know, I suppose, there are only two weeks more of football. What’s your line, Burtis?”</p><p>“Line?” asked Kendall vaguely.</p><p>“Yes; I mean what position have you played?”</p></div> </div>
