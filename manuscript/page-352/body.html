They’ve only scored two all season.”</p><p>“One of those was a fluke,” added Dan.</p><p>“What we’ve got to watch out for are forward passes. They’ve been getting off some fine ones lately.

How is Stearns this morning?”</p><p>“A bit lame,” replied Dan. “He will be all right to-morrow, I guess.”</p><p>“We’ll let him lay off to-morrow. It will be light work for all unless this weather changes. It’s almost like summer to-day. Well, I must be getting back. How are you feeling, Vinton?”</p><p>“All right,” was the reply.</p></div> </div>
