<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">one thing I want to say, fellows, and it’s this. We’re going to win this year—”</p><p>The cheers burst forth deafeningly, and it was a full minute before Goodyear could go on.</p><p>“Just as we did last year and other years before that.” (Another demonstration, but briefer.) “But to do it we must all get together and stand right back of the team every minute. It’s school loyalty that does the business. Every fellow who has been on a team knows what it means to feel  that the school is right back of him. It means a lot, I tell you; I don’t say that it wins games, but it comes mighty near it sometimes. The team may have its failures; it can’t win all the time; but it isn’t going to help matters if you start ‘knocking.’ There may be mistakes made; that happens now and then; but don’t ‘roast’ the team for it. Don’t roast anyone; get behind and push harder than ever! That’s all, fellows. Mr. Collins will now speak a few words to you.”</p></div> </div>
