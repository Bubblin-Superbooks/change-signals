And I won’t be able to play baseball in the spring because I’ll have to train with the Track Team!”</p><p>“You’re too ambitious,” laughed Dan. “Why not be satisfied with the glory you have? You’re a good cross-country runner, you’ve won your letter in hockey and track; isn’t that enough?”</p><p>“But I’m not thinking of glory,” argued Gerald. “I want to play football because I like it.”</p><p>“Then join your class team.”</p><p>“That isn’t—isn’t the same thing.”</p><p>“Why not? It’s football. And you say you don’t want the glory.”</p></div> </div>
