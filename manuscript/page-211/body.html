Was he alone?”</p><p>“Yes, he was all by his lonesome, and he looked sort of tall; about your height, maybe. He had his coat off and wore darkish clothes. That’s all I could see.”</p><p>“But why the dickens didn’t you say something about it? Have you seen him since?”</p><p>“No, but I haven’t looked for him. I didn’t say anything about it because I forgot it. And, anyway, I supposed you knew; thought you’d sent him down there to practice.”</p><p>“I wish I did know! A chap who can kick five goals out of ten would be a find. You’re not joking, Arthur?”</p><p>“Of course I’m not,” responded Arthur impatiently. “If you really don’t know who he is I advise you to find him, for he certainly could kick goals that day!”</p></div> </div>
