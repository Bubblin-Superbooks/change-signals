Mr. Collins put out his hand and Kendall placed his in it:</p><p>“Being on probation doesn’t prohibit you from paying me a call sometimes, Burtis. You know my room. Come in and see me. I’ve got some books you might like to see, and I’m always glad to loan them to boys who I believe will treat them well.”</p><p>“Thank you, sir.” Kendall walked to the door.  There, with his hand on the door, he turned. “There’s—there’s just one thing, Mr. Collins,” he said earnestly. “I know you had to—to do this. I guess my story ain’t—I mean isn’t—very likely. But I wish you’d just try your very hardest, sir, to believe that I was telling the truth.”</p><p>“I will try, Burtis. If it is the truth, my boy, it will prove itself some day. If it does you won’t be more pleased than I shall. Good morning.”</p><p>“Good morning, sir.”</p></div> </div>
