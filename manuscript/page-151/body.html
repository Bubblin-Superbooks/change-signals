I wish I could get him back here this fall to take charge of the punters. I believe I’ll write and ask him.”</p><p>“He couldn’t come, I guess,” said Tom. “He’s on the Yale Varsity this year.”</p><p>“I know, but he might get away for a week just before the Broadwood game and put the finishing touches on for us.

Why won’t he let you?”</p></div> </div>
